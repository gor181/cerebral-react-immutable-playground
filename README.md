Cerebral + React + ImmutableJS test run
===

It renders a simple Counter component which increments by 1 each second.  
It has a simple test checking whether the React component has rendered.
Used as a start learning point for Cerebral.  

Usually you would organize the signals/actions accross folders, placing all in main.js is easier for
the first time :)

### Usage

```
npm install && npm start
open http://localhost:8080
```
